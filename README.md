# awsx
AWSX is the modular command line CLI for for Appkube platform. All the subcommands are written as plugins for the main commands.
Appkube job engine calls those CLI commands for all its supported automation jobs. The commands are also directly embeddded in AWSX-Api
server. 

Please refer to Appkube Architecture diagram for details on how the appkube platform calls this commands.

Please refer the specification of subcommands for every subcommands input/ output / algos.

# How to build / Run / Debug 
    # Compile GO program: go build
    * Open command prompt and go to the project directory where a go file having main() function available
        cd /opt/mycode/awsx
    
    * go build without argument
        The go build command compiles the packages, along with their dependencies.    
        $ go build
        - If we don't provide an argument to this command, go build will automatically compile go program in your current directory
        - When we run go build, by default Go decide the name of the generated executable by using the module created earlier. \    
          When the go mod init awsx command was run, it created the module with the name 'awsx', which is why the binary generated is named 'awsx' in turn.
        - From the command line in, run the new awsx executable to confirm that the code works.
            * On Linux or Mac:
                $ ./awsx
            * On Windows:
                $ awsx.exe

    * go build with argument
        -  With -o flag, Go can chooses a name of the executable 
            go build -o [optional file path]/<executable name>
        - To test this out, change the name of the to 'awsxcmd' and have it placed in a sub-folder called bin. You donâ€™t have to create this folder; Go will do that on its own during the build process.
            $ go build -o bin/awsxcmd
                - The -o flag makes Go match the output of the command to whatever argument we chose. In this case, the result is a new executable named 'awsxcmd' in a sub-folder named 'bin'
                - To test the new executable, change into the new directory and run the binary
                    $ cd bin
                    $ ./awsxcmd

    # Install GO program: go install
        * The go install command behaves almost identically to go build, but instead of leaving the executable in the current directory, or a directory specified by the -o flag, it places the executable into the $GOPATH/bin directory.
        * The benefit of go install is that the executable binary can be executed outside of the source directory. 
          $ go install
            NOTE - The go install command does not support the -o flag, so it will use the default name described earlier to name the executable.
    
    # Compile and run the go program with go run command
        * Open command prompt and go to the project directory where a go file having main() function available
            cd /opt/mycode/awsx
        * Run the program with go run command
            go run ./main.go
            - In our example, our main() function is available in main.go
            - We can provide program arguments or flags to the main() function
                go run ./main.go arg1 arg2
                go run ./main.go --flag1=value --flag2=value

# Command structure
    <main command> <persistant flags> <sub-command> <sub-command flags>
    e.g. awsx --vaultURL=vault.dummy.net --accountId=xxxxxxxxxx  getElementDetails  --zone=us-west-2
    
    awsx:               It is the main parent command
    --vaultURL:         It is persistant flag which pass the vault url to the sub-command. Vault is a separate server which store user cloud credentials in key=value pair in encrypted format. \
    --accountId:        This persistant flag pass the AWS account id to the sub-command. Sub-command pass this account id as key to the vault serve to get user credentials \
    getElementDetails:  It is the sub-command of parent awsx
    --zone:             Sub-command flag which provide AWS region to the sub-command

    In Dev Env , you could run the awsx also as follows:

        go run ./main.go --vaultUrl=http://localhost:10000/vi/account --accountId=xxxxxxxxxx
        * On Linux or Mac:
            
            $ ./awsx --vaultUrl=http://localhost:10000/vi/account --accountId=xxxxxxxxxx
        * On Windows:
            $ awsx.exe --vaultUrl=http://localhost:10000/vi/account --accountId=xxxxxxxxxx


# How to write a plugin subcommand
The best way to start writing an subcommand is to follow the example subcommand -
https://github.com/Appkube-awsx/awsx-cloudelements

The process is as follows:
1. Create a independent git repo for the subcommnad like https://github.com/Appkube-awsx/awsx-cloudelements

2. Clone the repo to your local machine to add code git clone https://github.com/Appkube-awsx/awsx-cloudelements.git

3. Go in the awsx-cloudelements directory and execute the following commands
    a. initialize the project
        go mod init github.com/Appkube-awsx/awsx-cloudelements
    b. download the latest version of cobra cli
        go get github.com/spf13/cobra@latest
    c. install the Cobra cli
        go install github.com/spf13/cobra-cli@latest
    d. execute cobra-cli init command. This command will generate the application with the correct file structure and imports:
        cobra-cli init

4. The above command will create directory structure as below and generate the basic cli code in root.go and main.go

    awsx-cloudelements
        |
        |__cmd
            |__root.go
        |__main.go

        In the root.go you will find the code as below

            var rootCmd = &cobra.Command{
                Use:   "aws-cloudelements",
                Short: "A brief description of your application",
                Long: `A longer description that spans multiple lines and likely contains
                        examples and usage of using your application. For example:

                        Cobra is a CLI library for Go that empowers applications.
                        This application is a tool to generate the needed files
                        to quickly create a Cobra application.`,
                // Uncomment the following line if your bare application
                // has an action associated with it:
                Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
                    fmt.Println("Calling aws-cloudelements")
                },
            }

            func Execute() {
                err := rootCmd.Execute()
                if err != nil {
                    log.Fatal("There was some error while executing the CLI: ", err)
                    os.Exit(1)
                }
            }

            func init() {
                
            }

            - In the Run inline function we should write our cli code. 
            - In our example we have written a fmt.Println("Calling aws-cloudelements")
            - When we execute this command, this message will be printed on console

        In main.go we should call the command. So the main.go should be as below:

            package main

            import "github.com/Appkube-awsx/awsx-cloudelements/cmd"

            func main() {
                cmd.Execute()
            }

5.  Run and test the code as follows:
            go run main.go
                - Program will print Calling aws-cloudelements on console 

            Another way of testing is by running go install command
            go install
            - go install command creates an exe with the name of the module (e.g. awsx-cloudelements) and save it in the GOPATH
            - Now we can execute this command on command prompt as below
            awsx-cloudelements

6.  Publish the code in git so that other modules can download this code as dependency from git

        a. Commit and push the code
        b. Tag the code. Use the following git commands to tag it
            git tag "v1.0.0"
            git push --tags
    
        c. Developers interested in this module, import it by running the go get command as below
            go get github.com/Appkube-awsx/awsx-cloudelements@v1.0.0
            
            In the above go get command (go get github.com/Appkube-awsx/awsx-cloudelements@v1.0.0) we have specified the version (v1.0.0).
            
            This version is the git tag, what we specified in the git tag command earlier. 

# How to embed sub-command in GO CLI
            We can add as many sub-commands as required
            1. Create a main cobra command. We have created the parent AwsxCmd as below
                var AwsxCmd = &cobra.Command{
                    Use:   "awsx",
                    Short: "awsx main command",
                    Long:  `awsx main command`,
                    Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
                    },
                }
            2. In the init function add the sub-command to the parent command
                func init() {
                    AwsxCmd.AddCommand(cmd.AwsxCloudElementsCmd)
                }

# How to download sub-command/module from git

    Open command prompt and go to the directory where go.mod file available
    
    * To download any specific version of a module, run go get command with version number
        go get github.com/Appkube-awsx/awsx-cloudelements@v1.0.1
    * To download latest version of a module, run go get command with @latest
        go get github.com/Appkube-awsx/awsx-cloudelements@latest
        - If we omit the version number or @latest, go get command downloads the latest version always
    *  After it we can do the code chage and run go build or go install on command prompt
    
# How to run a specific version of  sub-command/module from main awsx
    * make the change in go.mod file (in subcommand require section , you can import a specific version)
    * run go mod tidy command at command prompt. This will downlod the required modules in GOPATH

# [Type of flags in Cobra CLI](https://dev.to/divrhino/adding-flags-to-a-command-line-tool-built-with-go-and-cobra-34f1)
    Cobra has two types of flags:

    *    Persistent flags - available to the command it is assigned to, as well as all its sub-commands
    *    Local flags - only assigned to a specific command
